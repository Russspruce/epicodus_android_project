# El Forge

For the independent Android project, I decided to go with an app that will allow users to add games, create invites, and set up times to meet up with friends to play games.

## Prerequisites

*Android Studios

## Installation

* git clone [this repository](https://github.com/Russspruce/epicodus_android_project.git).
* Open Android Studios
* Select 'Open Existing Project'
* Select 'epicodus_android_project'

## Description

This app was inspired by my group of friends, as we seem to have a difficult time getting a time together to play.  With the way everyone's schedule is, making time to play games can be quite a chore.  The purpose of this app is that it allows users to be able to schedule a session, invite people they wish to game with, and gives them the option to accept of decline.  Once accepted, they can get reminders of when the session is, and alert them when it is time.
